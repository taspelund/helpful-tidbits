This repository is meant to store any scripts, notes, projects, one-liners, or references that have been, and may continue to be, beneficial.

Currently there are two directories: `scripts`, and `projects`.

 - `scripts`: Smaller, single-purpose programs meant to solve a specific problem and run in a one-shot fashion
 - `projects`: Programs created for learning/entertainment purposes
